- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paolopierdo, and my best passion is sport, in particular football, in fact i'm playing since i was 6 years old.
- ğŸŒ± I live in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and currently i'm studying at University of Bologna, Statistical Sciences, and in September 
i will start Data Science master degree. I'm very interested about the impact that data can put on the companies of every field, and my 
dream (and my goal) is to create and develop something that could create very real impact on the football teams.
